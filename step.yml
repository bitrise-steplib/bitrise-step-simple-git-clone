  Simple Git Clone
summary: |-
  The step checks out the defined repository state without interfering with environmental variables.
description: |
  The checkout process depends on the checkout properties: the Step checks out a repository state defined by a branch, git commit or a git tag.

  ### Configuring the Step

  1. The **Git repository URL** is required field, the address of the repository that needs to be cloned.
  2. The **Clone destination** is required field, the local path where we need to clone. This is set by default to *_tmp* in current work directory
  3. In the **Clone Config** section there should be exactly one set of the following:
     - **Branch**
     - **Tag**
     - **Commit**
